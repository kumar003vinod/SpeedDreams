Track name: Caddo Speedway

Based on Texas Motor Speedway, Fort Worth, Texas.
A quad-oval speedway measuring 1.5 miles (2.4 km) around and
banked 24 degrees in the turns.
The project name comes from the Caddo tribe, who use the word 'Texas'
meaning "friends" or "allies" in their language.

Note: the pits are included, but Speed Dreams / TORCS has a limitation
currently so it cannot draw a decent pit building when the pit includes
a turn. So I added the pit definition but expect some graphical weirdness
on track. Let's hope Speed Dreams will be able to get rid of this
age-old limitation soon.
