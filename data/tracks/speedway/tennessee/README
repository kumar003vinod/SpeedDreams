Track name: Tennessee Half Mile Arena

Based on Bristol Motor Speedway, Bristol, Tennessee.
A half-mile, steeply banked paperclip design race track, opened in 1961.
It currently hosts several NASCAR race weekends annually.

Note: the banking on Bristol has long been disputed. They had
advertised it as 36 degrees, however nowdays it is claimed to have
'only' 26-30 degrees banking. One of the resources says:
"While the turns are still advertised at 36 degrees of banking,
the banking in the corners appears to be 22 degrees in the
bottom groove, 25 in the middle, and 27 at the top of the wall.
These measurements were determined using a digital
angle finder and a level."

Such a track profile - an elliptic track - is not available in
Speed Dreams / TORCS, so I had to make a tough decision:
I decided to have them at 28 degrees, as a mean average :)
The straights are 6-10 degrees, so I've set them to 8 degrees.

Note #2: Pits on BMS are tricky. In reality, both straights are used
for pits, but in Speed Dreams / TORCS we cannot handle that situation.
So only one pit area is designed, but the entry/exit path to it is
unusually long, starts/ends in the opposite straight. However, the track
is so short that a decent entry path is needed for the robots.
