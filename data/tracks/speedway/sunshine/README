Track name: Sunshine State Superspeedway

Based on Daytona International Speedway, Daytona Beach, Florida.
A 2.5 mile, steeply banked, high-speed tri-oval race track, opened in 1959.
It currently hosts several NASCAR, GrandAm, ARCA & AMA races each year.

Note #1 the pits are included, but Speed Dreams / TORCS has a limitation
currently so it cannot draw a decent pit building when the pit includes
a turn. So I added the pit definition but expect some graphical weirdness
on track. Let's hope Speed Dreams will be able to get rid of this
age-old limitation soon.
