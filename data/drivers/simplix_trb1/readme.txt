//
// The old simplix_trb1 setups made for simuv2 do not work anylonger.
// (Changes of the tracks surface parameters!)
//
// So I started to ceate new setups for simuV2.1.
// But this is still work inprogress.
//
// The default setups are based on spring only!
// There was still no check for all other tracks.
// 
// (See brondehach, corkscrew, espie and karwada as preview)
