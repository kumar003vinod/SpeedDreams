Skilling:

The skilling is used to define the range of lap times for the gamers opponents.
This can be done on two separate levels.
The first level is the global level (for all cars).
There is the file ...\config\raceman\extra\skill.xml.
It contains one parameter to be set in the range of 0.0 (fast) to 10.0 (slow).

The second level is the personal level (for a driver N).
There is the file ...\drivers\simplix_ls1\N\skill.xml.

To Enable/Disable the skilling for all cars of a simplix robot there is a file
...\drivers\simplix_ls1\default.xml.
Here you can enable skilling (1) or disable it (0).
